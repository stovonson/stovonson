# Hi! I make stuff.

In the past, I’ve made websites, Minecraft modpacks, Portal maps and YouTube videos.

Currently, I’m making Webham, an online text-based RPG and this website (it’s always a WIP!)

I’m fluent in HTML and CSS; I’m still trying to understand JS! Other than coding, I’m good with most computer stuff in general (Word, Excel, etc.).

I’m also quite a good writer (not my ego, watch a video of mine). I mainly write about large labyrinths, inspired by Aperture Science from Portal and Rapture from BioShock.

I enjoy coding, writing, listening to music, designing, drawing and much more! Too much to list here.

Well, that’s it for now, maybe I’ll add more here later!
